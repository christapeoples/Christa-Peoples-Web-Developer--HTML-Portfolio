<h1>About Me</h1>
<section style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
  <p>
    Hello! My name is <strong>Christa Peoples</strong>, the founder of <strong>OmHustle</strong> — a lifestyle brand that blends mindfulness, ambition, and creativity. 
    I’m an office professional, a single mother, and an entrepreneur building my own path to financial freedom through digital business and online income streams.
  </p>
  <p>
    Guided by a Buddhist mindset, I believe success starts with clarity, consistency, and inner peace. 
    OmHustle represents that balance — the “Om” for mindfulness, and the “Hustle” for ambition. 
    My mission is to help others tap into both sides: the calm and the grind.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through OmHustle, I aim to share inspiration, digital resources, and creative products that motivate people to live intentionally, 
    work smarter, and stay grounded while building their dream life. 
    I also offer workshops and online courses that delve deeper into personal development, helping individuals cultivate their unique strengths and navigate the challenges of modern life.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a web developer, I understand the importance of creating an online presence that reflects one's values and aspirations. 
    I incorporate modern web development practices to ensure that my resources are accessible and engaging for everyone.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue this journey, I am committed to fostering a community where like-minded individuals can connect, share their stories, and support one another. 
    Together, we can create a ripple effect of positivity and empowerment, encouraging everyone to pursue their passions and achieve their goals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Join me on this exciting adventure with OmHustle, where we embrace both the tranquility of mindfulness and the drive of ambition, 
    paving the way for a fulfilling and balanced life. Let's inspire each other to reach new heights while staying true to ourselves.
