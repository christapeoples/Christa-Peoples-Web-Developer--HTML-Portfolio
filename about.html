<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
    Hello! My name is <strong>Christa Peoples</strong>, the founder of <strong>OmHustle</strong> — a lifestyle brand that blends mindfulness, ambition, and creativity. 
    I’m an office professional, a single mother, and an entrepreneur building my own path to financial freedom through digital business and online income streams.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
    Guided by a Buddhist mindset, I believe success starts with clarity, consistency, and inner peace. 
    OmHustle represents that balance — the “Om” for mindfulness, and the “Hustle” for ambition. 
    My mission is to help others tap into both sides: the calm and the grind.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.6; color: #555;">
    Through OmHustle, I aim to share inspiration, digital resources, and creative products that motivate people to live intentionally, 
    work smarter, and stay grounded while building their dream life.
